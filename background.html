                <p>I am originally from Japan and I have been in Canada for more than 10 years. I enjoy the diversity in Vancouver. I feel privileged to get to enjoy food from all over the world. Since I came to Canada, I have spent the majority of my time in Vancouver. However, I have lived in Abbotsford, Surrey as well as Calgary and Edmonton in Alberta. I am very interested in visiting other parts of Canada. </p>

The most promising offer turns out to be the driver for the African-American classical pianist Don Shirley for a concert tour into the Deep South states. Although hardly enthused at working for a black man, Tony accepts the job and they begin their trek armed with The Negro Motorist Green Book, a travel guide for safe travel through America's racial segregation. Together, the snobbishly erudite pianist and the crudely practical bouncer can barely get along with their clashing attitudes to life and ideals. However, as the disparate pair witness and endure America's appalling injustices on the road, they find a newfound respect for each other's talents and start to face them together. In doing so, they would nurture a friendship and understanding that would change both their lives."(as cited in IMDb website)</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkZxoko_HC0">Click here to watch Green Book official trailer</a></div></section>

On the way to their new home, Chihiro's father makes a wrong turn and drives down a lonely one-lane road which dead-ends in front of a tunnel. Her parents decide to stop the car and explore the area. They go through the tunnel and find an abandoned amusement park on the other side, with its own little town. When her parents see a restaurant with great-smelling food but no staff, they decide to eat and pay later. However, Chihiro refuses to eat and decides to explore the theme park a bit more. She meets a boy named Haku who tells her that Chihiro and her parents are in danger, and they must leave immediately. She runs to the restaurant and finds that her parents have turned into pigs. In addition, the theme park turns out to be a town inhabited by demons, spirits, and evil gods. At the center of the town is a bathhouse where these creatures go to relax. The owner of the bathhouse is the evil witch Yubaba, who is intent on keeping all trespassers as captive workers, including Chihiro. Chihiro must rely on Haku to save her parents in hopes of returning to their world."(as cited in IMDb website)</p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/plotsummary">Click here for more details about the movie</a></div></section>
